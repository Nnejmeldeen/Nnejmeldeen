Previously, I was a Data Science and Machine Learning Analyst intern at Vodafone Egypt and a Finance and Treasury Analyst Intern at Schneider Electric Egypt. I managed cash functions and demonstrated exceptional skills in machine learning and data visualization.

I graduated summa cum laude from Ain Shams University with a Bachelor of Business (Economics). My academic achievements include 2nd place in RoboCup Egypt 2019, Top Performer Vodanation Intern, and one of the Top 5 projects in the Google MENA Solution Challenge 2021.
